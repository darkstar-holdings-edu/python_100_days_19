## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

The things you need before installing the software.

- [pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/index.html) [^1]
- tkinter

[^1]: Note: I use `pipenv` becaue I like the combination of the `venv` and `pip` commands together. However, I know it's not for everyone. So I've created a `requirements.txt` file if you don't like `pipenv` and just want to use `pip` instead.

### Installation

```sh
pipenv install --dev
pipenv shell
```

## Usage

- `main.py`: Just a place holder. It does nothing!
- `etch_a_sketch.py`: A simple TK etch-a-sketch.
- `project.py`: Turtle Races! Place your bets!
